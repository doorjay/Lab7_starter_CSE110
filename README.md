I think that putting our automated tests woulf be best done wihtin a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed.
This ensures that everytime you push code, it gets checked right then and there. It allows you to incrementally test
specific parts of your program automatically instead of havnig to do it manually or all at once when you think you're
"done".

No. A unit test would be what you'd use to check expected output
